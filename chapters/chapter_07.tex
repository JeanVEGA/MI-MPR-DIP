\chapter{Conclusion}\label{cha:conclusion}

	Purpose of this chapter is to summarize everything that has been done in a manner of this master's thesis and to
	describe results of RESTful API team's work.
	
	Results are evaluated against primary tasks and Catalogue of requirements~\ref{sec:catalogue}.
	
	\section{RESTful API and its application}
	
	Functional requirements and special requirements of the other two teams practically describe public interface of
	RESTful API.
	Positive result is that all points of Functional requirements are fulfilled.
	
	What I was unable to achieve is to implement Admission filters. Lower priority of this special requirement by Web UI
	team caused its last position in implementation plan, which unfortunately was not completely finished. This however has
	no critical impact on RESTful API's functionality.
