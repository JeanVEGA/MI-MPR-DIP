\chapter{Implementation}\label{cha:implementation}

	Main focus of this chapter is on development and its progress. It describes application structure, its layers, used
	principles, design patterns and conventions taking the analytical part into account.

	\section{Environment and new Spring Roo project setup}
	
	\subsection{Development platform}
	
	It is not a secret that developing applications for Java platform is resource consuming and requires solid performance
	for effective work. Luckily today's computers provide good computing power since mid-level price range and purchasing
	multi-core CPU and several GB of RAM is a standard.
	
	My configuration during development and writing this master's thesis was:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Dell Latitude E6410 laptop
		\item CPU Intel Core i5 Quad Core @ 2.5GHz
		\item 4GB RAM DDR3
		\item 120GB SSD MLC hard drive 
	\end{itemize}
	
	What is more important these days is developer's software equipment. Starting with OS, 64bit is a must. It depends on
	a personal preference to use IDE or not and then of course various support tools like console or term emulator,
	monitoring tools, \ldots

	This is what I have been using:	

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Windows 7 64bit
		\item Java 7 runtime (Oracle's JDK 1.7.0\_01)
		\item Java 6 compile (due to Spring Roo, however, 1.7 became supported by the time of writing this work)
		\item Maven 3.0.3
		\item Cygwin 1.7.10 with Bash as a primary shell in Console2
		\item Spring Roo 1.2.0, upgraded to 1.2.1, planned 1.2.2 upgrade with Java 1.7 support
		\item Eclipse IDE, 3.7.2 Indigo
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Spring STS
			
			Spring Roo's installation path needs to be set up.
			\item JBoss Tools  
			
			Maven tool should be switched from Eclipse's embedded implementation to the system wide installed one.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	To make all this work, it is required to set up system environment variables properly. Especially:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item JAVA\_HOME
		
		Pointing to the JDK 7 installation directory.
		\item MAVEN\_HOME
		
		Pointing to the Maven 3 installation directory.
		\item ROO\_HOME
		
		Pointing to the Spring Roo 1.2 installation directory.
		\item append all the above concatenated with \textbf{/bin} to the \textbf{PATH} variable 
	\end{itemize}
