\chapter{RESTful API with JAX-RS}\label{rest}

	Nowadays, Internet consumers demand fast growth of various services and integration of their favourite ones. As en
	example I can point out synchronization of contact list between very popular social networks, e-mail providers and
	phone contact lists. 
	
	Other example may be growing amount of \verb|mashups|\footnote{Applications that are created via
	combination of multiple different services. Such application, almost exclusively web based, can be created very quickly
	by consuming several APIs. Not necessarily from the same provider.} and uncountable number of
	\verb|startups|\footnote{Constantly rising amount of web applications, that focus on fast growth of attracted users.
	They offer various services, which are often very innovative and experimental. One successful example is popular
	social network and my favorite information channel - Twitter.}, who often provide RESTful or different type of public
	API.
